# py_dist_zmpck
distributed Python3 using zeromq and Messagepack
Very simple minded system to allow localised distributed computing based on Python3.

Consists of three main components:
1. a local library zlocal.py (example)
2. a reply server  zm_reply_m.py
3. request clients zm_req.py (example)

Requires python install for pyzmq messagepack, etc details to follow
